Taking inspiration from terminal navigation on computers in the past/present, this UI Kit is a collection of ReactJS components to integrate into a website or app. The components fit nicely in the pre-built grid, with a number of different column options. Contains a range of different cards to be inserted into the grid setup, with interactivity and animations built in.
